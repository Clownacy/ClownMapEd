- Don't bother drawing sprites that are off-screen.
- 'Select unmapped tiles' shows that auto-scrolling is still screwy (Sonic 2 Sonic sprites).
- Tall sprites make the sprite viewer taller.
- Extra controls: https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/sonmaped-sprite-mappings-editor.8736/
- Save states.
- Remember current sprites across restarts.
- Make tile viewer selection XOR with the background colour too.
