- Popup when you try to load mappings after loading DPLCs.
- Popups on errors such as unable to open file.
- Sprite spacing (figure out what algorithm SonMapEd uses).
- Add scrollbar to tile viewer.
- Don't bother drawing sprites that are off-screen.
- 'Select unmapped tiles' shows that auto-scrolling is still screwy (Sonic 2 Sonic sprites).
- Tall sprites make the sprite viewer taller.
